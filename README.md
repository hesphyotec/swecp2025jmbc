### Last Week:
I began with front-end development and design for our recipe project. I created a simple entry page to the application, which contains the app title, as well as buttons that take you to either a login page or an account creation page.
### Next week:
I plan to create the home page of the app, with buttons to go to different pages from there, like one to scan barcodes/receipts, another to scan foods directly, and another to add ingredients manually.

### Week 1:
#### What I did
  - I spent most of this week learning about SQLite and refreshing my C++ knowledge
  - I also spent substantial time researching recommendation algorithm types to find which ones would best fit our use case.
  - Finally, I created the database that our recommendation algorithm will use
#### What I will do next week
  - I will write the very basic math for our recommendation algorithm
  -If as a group we get far enough, I will try to incorporate the other databases into mine, e.g. making my primary key the same as the userâ€™s primary key.
  -If I do the very basic math and need more to do, I will start the AI receipt reader.
